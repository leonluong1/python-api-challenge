# City and Hotel Weather Analysis
Module 6 Python API Challenge -- Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp

This project is about examining 10,000 cities around the world and looking at their weather patterns like temperature, humidity and wind speeds. 
We analyze these different variables to draw correlations with other metrics to gain valuable insight.
Then, we looked at different hotels around some of these cities and created interactive maps using hvplot.

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my API, hvplot and Json knowledge as well as my Pandas, Matplotlib, and Stats knowledge. Starter code was provided.

The file types in this repository are ipynb files, csv files, png files and md files.
